# Schoolbox+
Schooolbox+ is a chrome extension packed with a set of tools to help improve the experience of Schoolbox,
for example displaying the exact details of the box plot within the marks section.

This is a work in progress.

**Schoolbox+ will interact with some of your data in order for its features to be functional. It does not do anything else with the data other than its intended use. The source code is always available for inspection.**

## Installation/update
Because ~~the Chrome Web Store Developer registeration fee($5) is unaffordable~~ I have paid the fee but the approval process is far too tedius, you will have to install the extension locally.

### 1. Getting the files
If you have Git or Github Desktop installed, preferably clone the repository instead. You can then pull later updates.

Otherwise, download the archive directly. Extract the folder within the archive. **If you are updating, delete the previous folder that you downloaded.**
